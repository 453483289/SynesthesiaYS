# SynesthesiaYS
Synesthesia, implemented as Yices scripts

Implementation for Synesthesia, a semi-automated compiler for shellcode with encoding restrictions. Run the scripts using yices 2.x with the command-line option "--mode=ef".

The ideas behind this project were discussed in my presentation at EkoParty 2016: http://www.msreverseengineering.com/blog/2016/11/8/synesthesia-modern-shellcode-synthesis-ekoparty-2016-talk

Please see my blog entry on the subject for a high-level description of the project and the contents of this repository: http://www.msreverseengineering.com/blog/2017/7/15/the-synesthesia-shellcode-generator-code-release-and-future-directions

Forgive my atrocious file naming convention.
